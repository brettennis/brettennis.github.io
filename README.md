# Cinebench Release 23

---

## Introduction

Cinebench is a way for users to easily evaluate their computer's hardware capabilities. The application uses a powerful 3D engine to test the rendering capabilities of a system's CPU. A computer's Cinebench score can easily be compared with others, giving users a standard number to represent real-world performance.

## Equipment Needed

- Cinebench Release 23 can run on any machine running Windows 10 machine on Intel or AMD 64-bit CPU with SSE3 support.
- Cinebench Release 23 is also available on macOS 10.13.6 or higher with 64-bit CPU running on Intel-based Apple Macintosh or on Apple M1 Mac.
- Machines running Cinebench Release 23 require at least 4 GB RAM.

## Installation

Installing Cinebench is easy. Download direct from Microsoft, the Mac App Store, or [follow this link](https://brettennis.github.io/download.html) to begin.

When the test is complete, you score will be indicated by a bright orange bar, with a number value on the right. 
A dark orange bar will also be displayed, representing what Cinebench expects from a machine with the same components.
